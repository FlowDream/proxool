/**
 * Class implementing a read/write lock. The lock has three states -
 * unlocked, locked for reading and locked for writing. If the lock
 * is unlocked, anyone can aquire a read or write lock. If the lock
 * is locked for reading, anyone can aquire a read lock, but no one
 * can aquire a write lock. If the lock is locked for writing, no one
 * can quire any type of lock.
 * <p>
 * When the lock is released, those threads attempting to aquire a write lock
 * will take priority over those trying to get a read lock.
