Q. When I run Ant I get an error:

   "The <checkstyle> task doesn't support the nested "property" element."

A. Checkstyle changed the way it is configured between versions 2.2 and 
   2.4. You need to use 2.4 or later (not sure about 2.3). Proxool
   includes checkstyle in the lib directory but if you have an older
   version of checkstyle somewhere on your classpath (for instance, in
   Ant's own lib directory) then you might have problems. Suggested 
   work around: get rid of the old version of checkstyle (if that 
   doesn't break anything else); edit the build.xml so it works
   with the old format.
