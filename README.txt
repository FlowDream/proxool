This code you have downloaded from cvs is in transition. Well,
not the code itself, but the structure of the directories. The
Ant script is new. The separation of source code is new. This
file is new.

By the end of September I will have this all documented properly
and the web site will accurately reflect the changes I have made.
Right now I am away from home and unable to make these changes
easily.

Okay. Expect release 0.4 in the next few weeks then.

Regards,
Bill
