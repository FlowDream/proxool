1. Install JDK1.2 (1.3 or later is recommended).

2. Install Ant 1.5 (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant)

3. Download the latest source code from the Proxool web site:

4. Run Ant.

Install JDK1.2 (1.3 or later is recommended). There are a number of JVMs
available, one of which can be found at http://java.sun.com.

 "Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like Make, but
 without Make's wrinkles."

 We use Ant to automate the build process. You don't _have_ to use Ant but
 it will be a lot easier if you do.

Download the source code from http://proxool.sourceforge.net/download.html
in tar or zip format. Unpack the file using tar, unzip, winzip, or the tool of your
choice. Don't understand what this means? If you are using Linux then look type
"man tar" at the command line and start reading. If you are using Windows then
look at http://www.winzip.com.

Move into the directory you created when you unpacked the source code. It will
contain a file called build.xml. This file is used by Ant to build the code. Ant has
a number of "targets" which tell it what to do. You run the target by calling ant
and passing the name of the target. If you pass no target name then the default
one is run. Here is a list of the targets.

build-jar: (default)
    ant, ant build-jar
    Build deploy/proxool-x.yy.jar. There are some issues relating to the version
    of the JDK you are using. See doc/jdk.html for more information. What gets
    built depends on what JDK you are using to run Ant:

    - Using JDK1.2: works with JDK1.2
    - Using JDK1.3 or later: works with JDK1.3 and later

build-jar-jdk1.2:
    ant build-jar-jdk1.2
    Build deploy/proxool-x.yy.jar. The jar file will only work with JDK1.2

build-jar-ext:
    This will include some addtional files in your jar. By passing a property
    to Ant you can specify what gets included. You can combine one or more
    properties. The properties (and their default values) are:

        ext.core=true
        ext.avalon=false
        ext.xml=false

    The different properties are explained below.

    ant build-jar-ext -Dext.core=true
    Exactly the same as using the build-jar target, except if you combine it
    with the other properties below.

    ant build-jar-ext -Dext.avalon=true
    Builds deploy/proxool-ext-x.yy.jar that includes an Avalon configuration
    class org.logicalcobwebs.proxool.ext.AvalonConfigurator that allows you to
    easily configure Proxool using Jakarta's Avalon Framework project. This
    will introduce a dependency on Avalaon's Framework. You can get the latest
    copy of this from http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/framework.

    ant build-jar-ext -Dext.xml=true
    Builds deploy/proxool-ext-x.yy.jar that includes an Avalon configuration
    class org.logicalcobwebs.proxool.ext.XMLConfigurator that allows you to
    easily configure Proxool using and XML file. This will introduce a dependency
    on JAXP. You can get the latest copy of this from
    http://java.sun.com/downloads.html. You will also need a JAXP compliant
    XML Parser, e.g. http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j
