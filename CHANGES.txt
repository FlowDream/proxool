0.8.2 - 5 November 2003

- Fixed bug where delegate properties weren't being passed onto the delegate driver. If you weren't
  passing any properties other than username and password to the delegate driver then this didn't
  cause a problem anyway. (Note that Proxool properties were being recognised correctly.) Added a
  new unit test specifically for this problem.

- Throw a friendlier exception if you try and add a statistics listener to a pool with
  no statistics

- Statistics now creates write locks less often. This was causing a problem during heavy loads
  even though the process of collecting statistics itself was very fast. If you had statistics
  turned off (the default) then this wasn't a problem anyway.

0.8.1 - 27 October 2003

- NullPointerException that occured during SQL logging for certain methods
  of excecuting statements has been fixed. Also, logging is optimised to
  do less work if nothing is listening. (No ConnectionListeners registered
  and log level not equal to debug or trace is off).

- Fixed typos in ShutdownHook. And now silently ignore IllegalStateException
  during removal of shutdownHook that occurs during JVM shut down.

0.8.0 - 26 October 2003

- We now use Cglib's proxy library. Together with dropping the use of Timer
  and only referencing ShutdownHooks at runtime we are now able to support
  JDKs 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 out of the box (Without Ant applied patches, which
  were horrible).

- Proxool is now available as a JMX component.

- New getDelegateConnection() method on ProxoolFacade gives you access
  to the delegate (third party) driver if you really need it. This makes
  your project dependent on both Proxool (to a small extent) and your
  third party driver (to a bigger extent) so should be done only if
  necessary.
  
- If ProxoolDriver gets garbage collected for any reason (outside our
  control) then we no longer shutdown the pool it relates to.

- AdminServlet now displays times for maximum-conneciton-lifetime,
  house-keeping-sleep-time, and  maximum-active-time properly
  regardless of your timezone. This was a display bug only and didn't
  effect the behaviour of the pool itself.

- Connections that are about to be expired no longer bother to reset
  themselves (because they'll never be used again anyway). This was
  causing problems if the connection had connectivity problems to the
  database which then caused problems during the reset.

- Added fatal-sql-exception-wrapper-class property. If a fatal exception is
  detected then it is wrapped up inside the exception defined by this
  property. This can make exception handling easier in   frameworks like
  Struts. Two wrappers are provided (FataSQLException and FatalRuntimeException)
  but you can also define your own.

- Added test-before-use and test-after-use properties. They will trigger a test of
  the connection (as defined by house-keeper-test-sql) just before a connection
  is handed out and just after it is closed (put back in the pool) respectively.
  These are both off by default.

- Fixed ConcurrentModificationException that happened in some
  environments during automatic statement closure.

- Fixed bug where if there was an Error during prototyping (not an SQLException,
  not a RuntimeException but something serious like NoClassDefFoundError) then
  the prototyper would keep attempting to make connections as fast as it could
  (and never succeed in making any). Much better for the prototyper to give
  up in that situation and try again when it is next asked (which, by default,
  would be 30 seconds later).

- Fix to documentation. Defining more than one type of fatal SQL exception
  is done with a comma delimited list.

- Fix to ProxoolFacade.redefine() which was in fact doing an update instead of a
  redefine. This didn't have any consequences unless you were calling this method
  explicitly in your code.

- Made the 'Attempt to use a pool with incomplete definition' exception a bit more
  informative. It is often because you are refering to an unregistered pool by its
  alias.

- SQL command logging (using the 'trace' property) now embeds the parameters into
  the SQL (if the SQL is parametised). This means that the log is almost like a
  journal - with the exception that any callable statements that return data retain
  the ? (question marks) that contain the output parameters.

- Batched statements are now correctly reported with the trace feature.

0.7.2 - 28 April 2003

- Moved DataSourceTest into Sandbox so that the Ant test target
  runs correctly.

- Fixed a bug in ConfigurationListener that meant that if you passed
  a Properties object to the Driver when asking for a connection to an
  existing pool it incorrectly called ConfigurationListenerIF.definitionUpdated
  when there was no change, and didn't call it when there was.

0.7.1 - 19 April 2003

- Added a lot of concurrency code - mainly using concurrent package
  written by Doug Lea. 

- Fixed display bug in AdminServlet - average active time was being
  displayed in milliseconds instead of seconds.

- Refactoring of how definitions are updated and redefined. Use
  ProxoolFacade.updateConnectionPool  to make incremental changes
  and ProxoolFacade.redefineConnectionPool to reset the definition
  and start again. (If you pass a Properties object to the DriverManager
  when asking for a connection this will call redefineConnectionPool.)

- if you change the url or any of the delegate properties for a pool's
  definition then all existing connections are automatically killed so that
  new ones are created that conform to the new definition.

- Change to ConfigurationListenerIF API. defintionChanged is now
  called definitionChanged (stupid spelling error).

- ConnectionListenerIF.onDeath now gets called for all connections
  closed during shutdown.

- Pools manually removed (using ProxoolFacade.removeConnectionPool)
  are no longer attempted to be removed during shutdown.

- Maximum-new-connections property has been deprecated in favour of
  the more descriptive simultaneous-build-throttle property.

- Refactoring of house keeper and prototyper so that the number of threads
  used by Proxool is more scalable. (Proxool used to create two threads
  per pool).

- Moved AdminServlet to servlet sub-package to make way for upcoming
  JMX admin implementation.

- Fixed bug where ConfigurationListenerIF.definitionUpdated was getting called
  when you passed a Properties object to the Driver regardless if whether the
  definition had changed.

0.7 - 21 February 2003

- We have dropped the dependency on commons-logging.jar
  by copying the code into our own project (retaining credit to
  the Jakarta team, naturally).

- New admin package provides statistical
  and snapshot information so you can measure how well Proxool, and
  your database, is doing.

- New AdminServlet provides statistical
  information for your web application.

- The JDK 1.2 patch code has been brought up to date and now
  passes all the unit tests.

- The listener code has been redone. Proxool now allows multiple
  listeners per pool. setFooListener has now been deprecated in
  favour of addFooListener. And it's now thread safe (just in case you
  add or remove a listener while the pool is running).

- The new ServletConfigurator will help you
  to configure and shutdown your pools simply by adding a few lines to
  your servlet configuration (web.xml) file and perhaps writing an XML file.
  No changes to your Java code.

- By using ShutdownHooks (with JDK1.3 or later) we get a cleaner, more
  reliable shutdown of the pools when the JVM stops.

- Removed ReloadMonitor (added in 0.5) because it made use of
  SystemProperties and this is prohbited by J2SE. You are now responsible
  for ensuring Proxool is shutdown if your application is reloaded within
  the same environment (as can sometimes happen in a web application).
  See ProxoolFacade.shutdown().

- Fixed bug when you asked DatabaseMetaData for the connection. It
  now gives you back the Proxool connection, not the underlying delegate
  connection.

- Fixed bug where if you registered, removed and then re-registered a pool
  then the new pool would not notice the Properties passed to it.

- If a connection encounters a fatal SQLException (as defined by the
  fatal-sql-exception property) it now wakes up the house keeper thread
  so other connections are tested as soon as possible (with the
  house-keeper-test-sql) rather than waiting for the next scheduled sweep.

0.6 - 23 January 2003

- ProxoolFacade API has changed slightly. Some of the methods no
  longer throw an SQLException but a ProxoolException instead.
  This might lead to some small changes in your code.

- There used to be some ambiguity about whether you referred to a
  pool by its alias or its full url (when using ProxoolFacade). This has
  now been fixed. This means you can now change the url (to use a
  different database for instance) without creating a new pool.

- Version information is now logged so you can tell what version of
  Proxool you are using.

- ConnectionPoolStatisticsIF now reports the time the pool was started.

- We now use FastArrayList (from Jakarta Commons) instead of the
  JDK's Vector for improved collection support.

- New XMLConfigurator and PropertyConfigurator to make it easy
  to configure proxool from a file.

- New ConfigurationListenerIF interface allows you to implement persistent
  configuration

- Bug fix for JDBC drivers that implement the Statement interface
  indirectly (that is, extend a class that implements it rather than
  implementing it directly). (Credit to Martin Crawford).

- Unclosed Statements are now automatically closed when the
  Connection is closed, in accordance with the JDBC spec.

- Rollback is called on all connections when they are closed (that is,
  returned to the pool). This has no effect if autoCommit it true (default)
  or any pending transactions have been committed or already rolled back.
  This will only have an effect if you currently close connections with
  pending transactions.

- New ProxoolFacade#getDelegateStatement allows you to get to
  the underlying JDBC Driver's original Statement if you really need
  to. (This isn't recommended unless you have no other choice).

- You can now update the URL for a pool, not just the properties.
  See ProxoolFacade#updateConnectionPool.

0.5 - 3 December 2002)

- Fix finalisation of old instances. If you deploy to some environments in
  a certain way then it is possible for the class to be reloaded without the
  finalize() method being called. This will result in spurious house keeping
  threads remaining. The new ReloadMonitor avoids this.

- Various improvements to the logging to make it more informative and
  cleaner.

- Checkstyle improvements. We now enforce variable names and line length.
  Javadoc enforcement to come soon.

- Made the onBirth() method of ConnectionListenerIF interface failsafe. And
  removed obsolete cleanupClob() method (which was never called anyway)..

- Removed redundant logFilename stuff from ConnectionPoolDefinition. All
  logging is handled by Jakarta Commons's Logging anyway.

- Fix when removing pools that meant that when you tried to add them again
  Proxool thought it was a duplicate (Credit to Dan Milstein).

- Improvements to the way Proxool detects changes to the pool definition
  when resending the Properties object when you get a connection. Now
  detects when it has changed which means that we don't do
  unnecessary configuration and log is improved (we now log properties
  as they are set or updated).

- Fix to the ProxyConnection within the equals() method that was causing
  identical conections to be incorrectly reported as unequal (which leads to
  problems when adding them to some collections).

- Improvements to test classes. Lots more tests.

- Added support for resetting connection properties when it is returned to
  the pool (autoCommit, catalog, readOnly, transactionIsolation, typeMap
  and holdability). These  properties are reset to the values when the connection
  was made everytime it is returned. (credit to Tim Morley)

- Connection.isClosed() now returns true when it is back in the pool.

- New trace property allows you to log each execution, the SQL, the parameters
  used, and the execution time (DEBUG level). Use proxool.trace=true property.
  You can also get this information if you register a ConnectionListenerIF (use
  ProxoolFacade's setConnectionListener() method). This won't effect performance
  if you're not listening or have trace off.

- Prototyping is now off by default. To enable prototyping you need to set the
  proxool.prototype-count property to something sensible (like 5, for instance).
  [Prototyping is where spare connections are when the number of available
  connections approaches zero.]

- Fix for catching fatal SQL exceptions. This is a feature that throws away connections
  that encounter certain types of exception.

0.4 - 19 September 2002

- Rethink of how we organise our source code so that we can easily build
  to include different optional components.

- Use the Jakarta Commons' ultra-thin log wrapper. This allows you to
  plugin whatever logging component you like.

- Switched to use of the Proxy class so that we are not tied to a particular
  version of the JDK. However, this does mean a bit of patching to work with
  JDK 1.2 (Proxy was introduced in 1.3). Fortunately, this patch is handled
  easily using Ant.

- Test classes now make use of Hypersonic. A pure Java database with a very
  small footprint. This means we can run the tests without having to rely on
  the existence of a separate database.

- Layout and code style changes in accordance with CheckStyle

- New XMLConfigurator using JAXP to configure your connection pools.

- Improvments in Junit testing.
