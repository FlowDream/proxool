0.4

- Rethink of how we organise our source code so that we can easily build
  to include different optional components.

- Use the Jakarta Commons' ultra-thin log wrapper. This allows you to
  plugin whatever logging component you like.

- Switched to use of the Proxy class so that we are not tied to a particular
  version of the JDK. However, this does mean a bit of patching to work with
  JDK 1.2 (Proxy was introduced in 1.3). Fortunately, this patch is handled
  easily using Ant.

- Test classes now make use of Hypersonic. A pure Java database with a very
  small footprint. This means we can run the tests without having to rely on
  the existence of a separate database.

- Layout and code style changes in accordance with CheckStyle

- New XMLConfigurator using JAXP to configure your connection pools.

- Improvments in Junit testing.
