Q. When I run Ant I get an error:

   "The <checkstyle> task doesn't support the nested "property" element."

A. Checkstyle changed the way it is configured between versions 2.2 and 
   2.4. You need to use 2.4 or later (not sure about 2.3). Proxool
   includes checkstyle in the lib directory but if you have an older
   version of checkstyle somewhere on your classpath (for instance, in
   Ant's own lib directory) then you might have problems. Suggested 
   work around: get rid of the old version of checkstyle (if that 
   doesn't break anything else); edit the build.xml so it works
   with the old format.

Q. Why is all the logging done to stdout.

Q. I'm running Intellij IDEA and I get an error when I try to build the javadoc
  using Ant.

A. Intellij started shipping there own JRE just before they released version 3.0.
  This JRE includes javac but not javadoc. The solution is to copy javadoc from
  a full JDK (preferably a similar version to the one shipped with IDEA) into
  the JRE's bin directory.
